NAR Philosophy

	In the NAR plugin we follow Maven's main principles, outlined below:
	
* Convention over configuration
	
** Standard directory layout for Native projects
		
** A single Native project produces a single output
		
** Standard naming conventions
		
* Declarative execution

* Reuse of build logic

* Coherent organization of dependencies
